# Ovals, Stars and Polygons
*(6:03 in video)*
## Ovals
```Oval(centerX, centerY, width, height)```

```Oval(200, 100, 50, 100, fill='yellow')```

---
## Stars
```Star(centerX, centerY, radius, points)```

Stars can have a special property called Roundness which can be anything from 0 to 100.  

```Star(200, 200, 50, 5, fill='dodgerBlue', roundness=10)```

---
## Regular Polygons
Here is the code for a regular polygon:

```RegularPolygon(centerX, centerY, radius, points)```

---
## Polygons (Any Shape)
To make any shape, you just make a list of the x,y coordinates of the corners. You can have as many as you need. 

```Polygon(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,x4,y4,x,y5)```
