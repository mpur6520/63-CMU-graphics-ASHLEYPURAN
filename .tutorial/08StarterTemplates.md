You can even 'cheat' and download a silhouette and paste it onto your Word grid.  (Make sure you choose to float the image in front of text.) Then you can just read off the coordinates that you want.

## Butterfly Starter
I have drawn a base for a butterfly.
Fork this repl and decorate the butterfly.
Add in a body, head, antennae and colourful decorations on the wings.
